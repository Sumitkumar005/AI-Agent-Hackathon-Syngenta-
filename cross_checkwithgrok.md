Cross-Checking Our Work with the Hackathon Requirements
The hackathon’s main aim is to create an intelligent agent system that helps supply chain pros by answering their questions. It needs to pull info from two sources: a document repository (like PDFs) and a structured database (like a CSV loaded into a database). The system should understand natural language, fetch data from both places, optionally enforce governance, and give actionable insights. Here’s how our project lines up:

What They Asked For vs. What We Did
Natural Language Understanding (NLU):
Requirement: The system must understand user queries in plain English.
What We Did: We kept the NLU from your old RAG chatbot, which already does a solid job of figuring out what users mean.
Check: ✅ Covered.
Document Retrieval:
Requirement: It should grab info from a document repository (e.g., PDFs).
What We Did: Your RAG system already handles retrieving info from documents perfectly.
Check: ✅ Covered.
Database Integration:
Requirement: It needs to query a structured database (e.g., CSV data).
What We Did: We added a feature to load the CSV into PostgreSQL and generate SQL queries for data-driven answers.
Check: ✅ Covered.
Hybrid Query Handling:
Requirement: It should answer questions that need both document and database info.
What We Did: We upgraded the system to combine both sources for a single response.
Check: ✅ Covered.
Insight Generation:
Requirement: It should provide actionable insights, not just raw answers.
What We Did: We added a module to analyze data and suggest smart next steps.
Check: ✅ Covered.
Governance Enforcement (Optional):
Requirement: Optionally, it should control who can access what based on roles or location.
What We Did: We suggested adding role-based and geographic access controls, but haven’t built it yet since it’s not required.
Check: Optional, so we’re still good without it.
Non-Functional Requirements
They didn’t list these explicitly, but we’ve thought about them anyway:

Performance: We suggested optimizing SQL queries and caching for speed.
Security: Governance features (if added) would handle this.
Usability: Your chatbot’s interface is already user-friendly.
Maintainability: The project’s modular setup makes it easy to tweak later.
Verdict: We’ve nailed all the must-haves. Governance is the only thing we haven’t fully done, but since it’s optional, we’re 100% on track.

Did We Build an Intelligent AI Agent?
Yes, we did! The hackathon wanted an "intelligent agent system" to revolutionize how supply chain folks interact with their data. Our system:

Understands natural language queries.
Pulls info from documents and a database.
Delivers answers with actionable insights.
It’s smart, interactive, and handles complex supply chain questions—just what they asked for. So, mission accomplished: we’ve built an intelligent AI agent that meets their aim.

Did They Ask for a Chatbot or an AI Agent?
Here’s the clarification you wanted:

What They Said: The handbook calls it an "intelligent agent system." No mention of "chatbot" anywhere.
What That Means: "AI agent" is a broad term—it could be a chatbot, a voice assistant, or even something non-conversational. But the handbook gives clues:
It talks about "a unified interface for complex business queries," which sounds conversational.
Sample questions like “What’s our policy on inventory write-offs?” or “How much inventory in the Southwest?” are perfect for a chatbot to handle.
Our Take: While they didn’t say “build a chatbot,” they described something a chatbot does well—answering questions naturally and conversationally. Your project, which is a chatbot, fits perfectly as an intelligent AI agent in this context.
So, to answer your question: They asked for an AI agent, not specifically a chatbot, but a chatbot is a valid and awesome way to deliver what they want. We’re spot on with our approach.

Final Thoughts
We’ve taken your old RAG chatbot and turned it into an intelligent AI agent that ticks all the hackathon’s boxes: document handling, database queries, hybrid answers, and insights. You’re ready to roll! If you’ve got extra time, maybe add those governance features for bonus points, but you’ve already completed their aim.
